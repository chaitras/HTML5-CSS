                              We like to see our location as a modern haven in a space age world. We offer all the modern comforts
                              like smart pins to provide access to locked areas, a fast complimentary WiFi, but still our interior
                              reflects the comfort of an 19th century luxury inn.
                              Space Bed-and-Breakfast has four guest rooms, a common lounge, and a dining area. Lunch
                              and dinner are only available with prior reservation, but it can be well worth the small effort.
                          </p>

                              <h4>        Standard double</h4>

                              Our two standard double rooms come with a comfortable queen size bed, and a basic
                              equipment.


                              <h4>
                                  Family room
                              </h4>
                              As the name states the family room offers more space with a double bed and two single beds.
                              For request a cot or a small extra bed is available.

                              Ask for additional child or baby accessories during the reservation.

                              <h4>Honeymoon suite</h4>
                              Our honeymoon suite is a luxurious room with a large king size bed.
                              The breakfast in bed includes also sparkling wine for those special moments.
